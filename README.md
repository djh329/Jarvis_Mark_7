This is the Root Project for the 7th Iteration of Jarvis. Further documentation to be added soon.

The key structural components of Jarvis are:
- an Ios App 
- A server which runs in the cloud to connect the app to all backend services
- A docker container running on a local machine. This syncs Jarvis to a cloud based filesystem

The main goals of Jarvis are to:
- Sync files and music across all devices
- Provide a uniform interface for various platforms
- Provide shortcuts and capabilities for common tasks including:
  - Retrieving a file
  - Emailing a file
  - Playing a specific playlist on Spotify
  - Granting ssh access to a remote machine

Functionality implements in past iterations of Jarvis to be included in the future:
- Weather Data
- Soundcloud Playlists
- Inteligent NLP (for Command Recognition)
